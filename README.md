# 3D Custom Shirt

Developed a dynamic web application that merges React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber with DALL路E AI's image generation, enabling users to design custom t-shirt graphics. This innovative platform guides users through the essentials of 3D modeling, integrating these models into React, and styling for a streamlined design, all while enriching user interaction with captivating animations.

## Technologies Used

- React Three Fiber
- Three.js
- DALL路E AI
- NPM
- Netlify
- TailwindCSS (assumed for styling)
- Framer Motion (assumed for animations)

## Features

- 3D Model Customization: Allows users to interact with and modify 3D t-shirt models in real-time.
- Camera Positioning and Lighting: Provides tools for users to understand and manipulate camera positioning and lighting in 3D space, enhancing the visual appeal of their designs.
- Code Scalability: Utilizes Higher Order Components (HOCs) for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.
- Integration with DALL路E AI: Enables the generation and application of bespoke images to t-shirt models based on textual prompts, allowing for extensive design personalization.
- Design Flexibility: Users can adjust colors, upload custom files, and download their final t-shirt design, showcasing their creativity.
- Responsive and Optimized: Ensures a seamless user experience across all devices, leveraging the power of 3D graphics and AI in creative design.
